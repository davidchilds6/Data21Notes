# A variable is a an object within the program
# In python we don't have to initialise a data type. If we type a number then python will recognise a number.
# variable_name = "Hello World"
# a = 21
# b = 5.3
#
# print(variable_name)
#
# print(a + b)
#
# # Check data types
# print(type(variable_name))
# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))

# We can ask for user input - another way to set variables

# name = input("What is your name?    ")
#
# print("Hello " + name)

# # F strings
# name = input("What is your name?    ")
# print(f"Hello {name}")

# # Exercise - Ask for name, age, height and dob
# name = input("What is your name?    ")
# age = input("How old are you?")
# height = input("How tall are you?")
# dob = input("When were you born?")
#
# print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old, {height} m tall and you were born on {dob}.")
